# Contributing

Thanks for helping with **Dark Promoters**. Keep these guidelines in mind:

- Read `AGENTS.md` for roles, tasks, and acceptance criteria.
- Use 2-space indents, UTF-8, and LF line endings for JSON.
- Card IDs follow `type_prefix_snake_case` (e.g. `act_demo`).
- Provide English and German text for card fields like `name` and `text`.
- Run `php api/cards.php` to ensure all card JSON loads without warnings.
- Run available tests or linters before submitting a PR.

For environment setup see `docs/ONBOARDING.md`.
